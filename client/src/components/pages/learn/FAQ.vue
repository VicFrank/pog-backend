        This is a very common issue with custom games. The error message essentially means that you or the host's custom game are not fully updated. There are a few ways to ensure you have the latest update.
        <ul>

            Option 1:
            <ul>
              <li>Uninstall the custom game</li>

              <li>Open your Dota again</li>
              <li>Install the Custom game mode</li>

              <li>If you see a download progress bar, then it should work. If you do NOT see it, it definitely did NOT work.</li>
